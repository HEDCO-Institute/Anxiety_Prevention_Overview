An Overview of Systematic Reviews with Meta-Analyses. It documents the methods and results of our rapid overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses on the effectiveness of anxiety prevention interventions delivered directly to students in primary and secondary school settings. We searched PubMed, ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I, and Social Science Premium Collection for systematic reviews that included a meta-analysis on school-based anxiety prevention interventions. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed full texts for eligibility, collected data, and critically appraised systematic reviews. To estimate effectiveness and explore sources of heterogeneity for interventions delivered directly to students during normal school hours, we conducted random effects meta-analyses using data from primary studies. We identified 16 eligible systematic reviews that included 326 primary studies overall; of these, 35 primary studies evaluated 43 experimental interventions delivered directly to 17,950 students during normal school hours. The majority of these 35 primary studies were cluster-randomized trials (28 studies, 80%) and included elementary school settings (25 studies, 71%). We did not detect a statistically significant difference on risk of meeting criteria for an anxiety diagnosis between students receiving anxiety prevention interventions relative to students in control groups (risk ratio = 0.65, 95% CI [0.42 to 1.01], 95% PI [0.34 to 1.26], \\(I^2\\) = 17%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.06). Students receiving anxiety prevention interventions had lower anxiety symptoms relative to students in control groups (standardized mean difference = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.16, -0.01], 95% PI [-0.38, 0.21], \\(I^2\\) = 18%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.01). Students receiving anxiety prevention interventions also had lower depression symptoms relative to students in control groups (standardized mean difference = -0.07, 95% CI [-0.13, -0.01], 95% PI [-0.27, 0.13], \\(I^2\\) = 0%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0). We did not detect a statistically significant difference on well-being between students receiving anxiety prevention interventions relative to students in control groups (standardized mean difference = -0.06, 95% CI [-0.18, 0.06], 95% PI [-0.18, 0.06], \\(I^2\\) = 0%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0). We could not conduct meta-analyses for all other outcomes. Based on the findings of previous reviews and our meta-analyses, school-based anxiety prevention interventions may reduce anxiety and depression symptoms. However, we have concerns about risk of bias in this body of evidence, and effects for anxiety symptoms vary considerably due to unidentified factors. While the evidence suggests schools are more likely than not to benefit from implementing these interventions in contexts similar to those in the review, users of this evidence should be aware that current research evidence suggests both positive and negative effects are possible. "],["objectives.html", "1 Objectives", " 1 Objectives This technical report is a companion to Do School-Based Anxiety Prevention Programs Support Youth? An Overview of Systematic Reviews with Meta-Analyses. It documents the methods and results of our rapid overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses on the effectiveness of anxiety prevention interventions delivered directly to students in primary and secondary school settings. An overview (also known as a “meta-review” or “umbrella review”) can systematically and coherently identify, collate, and synthesize systematic reviews into a single document on the best available evidence to inform policy and practice decisions (Aromataris et al., 2020; Gates et al., 2022; Pollock et al., 2022). School-based intervention is a promising approach to prevent youth anxiety (National Research Council, 2009). Schools are one of few settings where nearly all children and adolescents can be reached (Arora et al., 2019). The delivery of prevention services in the school setting importantly eliminates the many barriers that exist when families seek out mental health support, such as time, transportation, stigma around seeking mental health support, staffing shortages, and scheduling challenges (Werner-Seidler et al., 2021). Our overview aimed to assess the effects of school-based anxiety prevention interventions on anxiety diagnoses, subsyndromal anxiety, anxiety symptoms, and non-anxiety outcomes related to student well-being and educational achievement. Our overview also explored whether these effects vary by methodological, demographic, and intervention characteristics. Our goal of this overview of reviews on school-based prevention interventions is to support the decisions of education stakeholders related to the development of policies, practice guidelines, and professional preparation and continuing development programs focused on youth behavioral health. "],["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Eligibility Criteria 2.2 Information Sources 2.3 Search Strategy 2.4 Selection Process 2.5 Data Collection Process and Items 2.6 Risk of Bias 2.7 Synthesis Methods", " 2 Methods Our methods and reporting are informed by guidance from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P 2015) Statement (Moher et al., 2015), the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR) Statement (Gates et al., 2022), the PRISMA extension for reporting literature searches in systematic reviews (Rethlefsen et al., 2021), JBI guidance on umbrella reviews (Aromataris et al., 2020), and Cochrane guidance on overviews of reviews (Pollock et al., 2022). 2.1 Eligibility Criteria We included systematic reviews with a meta-analysis examining the effects of school-based anxiety prevention interventions delivered directly to primary and secondary school students. We used the definition of a “systematic review” provided in the PRISMA-P 2015 reporting guideline: “a systematic review attempts to collate all relevant evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria to answer a specific research question. It uses explicit, systematic methods to minimize bias in the identification, selection, synthesis, and summary of studies” (Moher et al., 2015). We used this definition to identify reviews that have the potential to provide reliable findings for evidence-informed decision-making. Based on this definition, our operational criteria for a systematic review were: (i) clear objectives, (ii) an explicit and reproducible methodology, (iii) a systematic search strategy for attempting to identify all studies that meet the review eligibility criteria, (iv) critical appraisal of the included studies, and (v) systematic synthesis of the characteristics and findings of the included studies. We excluded systematic reviews that did not report the results for a meta-analysis of school-based anxiety prevention interventions on at least one anxiety outcome (anxiety diagnosis, subsyndromal anxiety, or anxiety symptoms). We also excluded reviews on interventions delivered in school settings but only during out-of-school time (e.g., after school, summer break). Due to limitations in resources and review team language proficiency, we excluded reviews published in a language other than English. Although grey literature was eligible, we excluded reviews published only in a summary format (e.g., only as a conference abstract or executive summary). For our meta-analysis of data from primary studies in eligible systematic reviews, we included evaluations of a school-based anxiety prevention intervention directly delivered to primary and secondary school students during normal school hours. We excluded studies that included pre-school or college students if less than 50% of the sample was primary and secondary school students. We used the National Research Council (2009) definitions for primary (universal) and secondary (selective and indicated) prevention of prevention; we consequently excluded evaluations of interventions characterized by (1) a focus on broad mental health and well-being but not specifically on anxiety (even if anxiety was a measured outcome), (2) screening for or identifying students with anxiety, or (3) treating students with anxiety (based on either a verified diagnosis or use of an established cutoff score for a validated measure of anxiety). We also excluded interventions that did not have a component (1) delivered directly to students, (2) delivered during normal school hours, and (3) focused on anxiety specifically. Although we excluded primary studies without a comparison group, we did not restrict inclusion based on type of comparator intervention or method of assignment to intervention group. 2.2 Information Sources We searched for eligible systematic reviews published using the following electronic databases (with search platforms in parentheses): PubMed (National Library of Medicine), ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I (ProQuest), and Social Science Premium Collection (ProQuest). The Social Science Premium Collection includes the Criminology Collection, Education Collection (which includes Education Resources Information Center, or “ERIC”), International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Library &amp; Information Science Collection, Linguistics Collection, Politics Collection, Social Science Database, and Sociology Collection. Given the rapid timeframe of our overview, we did not search systematic review registries, web search engines, specific web sites, or journal tables of contents, nor did we conduct a search for primary studies missed by included systematic reviews. 2.3 Search Strategy Two authors experienced in conducting systematic reviews (KSF, ETS) developed the search strategy, and another author experienced in systematic reviews (SG) subsequently reviewed the strategy prior to execution using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) Guideline (McGowan et al., 2016). This PRESS peer review led to elimination of two terms: “NOT (universities[Mesh])” and “NOT subject(“university students”)” due to concerns that they would exclude studies of interest on K-12 students that make reference to universities and/or university students. We used Yale MeSH Analyzer to inform our search terms based on reviews identified in our preliminary scans of the literature (Ahlen et al., 2015; Caldwell et al., 2019; Dray et al., 2017; Feiss et al., 2019; Garber et al., 2016; Gee et al., 2020; Johnstone et al., 2018; Stockings et al., 2016; Werner-Seidler et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). We also used PubMed PubReMiner for term frequency analysis. To focus on literature published after the conceptualization of subsyndromal psychiatric disorders (Volz et al., 2023) and following JBI recommendations (Aromataris et al., 2020), we limited our search to publications from 1990 until the date of the search (May 3, 2023). Our search strategy did not involve the use of any published search filters. 2.4 Selection Process One team member (SDT) uploaded citations into our web-based systematic review data management software (DistillerSR) and used the “Duplicate Detection” function to identify and remove duplicates. We then used standardized forms in DistillerSR for the citation screening. After training in the standardized forms (led by SG) and DistillerSR software (led by SDT and SG), two reviewers (a combination of ED, EETS, MSC, and SG) independently screened the title and abstract of each citation for potentially eligible systematic reviews. Reviewers were not blind to journal titles nor to study authors and their institutions. We retrieved the full text for each citation deemed potentially eligible by at least one reviewer. Two reviewers (a combination of ED, MSC, and SG) then independently assessed each full text for eligibility. We included all systematic reviews deemed eligible by both reviewers. Reviewer pairs resolved any disagreements about full-text eligibility via discussion, conferring with a third reviewer as needed. We recorded reasons for excluding citations at the full-text stage. Rather than excluding overlapping but eligible systematic reviews at this stage, we identified and managed any overlap in the populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of included systematic reviews at later stages of the review (i.e., data collection and analysis). Two reviewers (MSC and SG) independently assessed all primary studies included in eligible reviews for eligibility following the same process described above for systematic review eligibility assessment. 2.5 Data Collection Process and Items We used standardized forms in DistillerSR for the data collection process based on a data collection codebook with all variables for which data were sought. After training in the data collection codebook (led by SG) and DistillerSR software (led by SDT), two reviewers (a combination of SG and either ED or MSC) independently collected data from eligible systematic reviews and primary studies. Reviewer pairs resolved any disagreements about data collection via discussion, conferring with a third reviewer as needed. Variables included bibliographic information (e.g., authors, year published), information related to the review question (i.e., population, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and settings), and methodological characteristics (e.g., risks of bias). Our primary outcome is anxiety diagnosis. Our secondary outcomes are subsyndromal anxiety and anxiety symptoms. Our tertiary outcomes are depression, educational achievement and attainment, self-harm, self-medication, stress, substance use, suicidal ideation, and wellbeing. We collected all outcome data compatible with one of the above domains from all eligible primary studies (Gates et al., 2022). SG and EETS discussed and decided on any additions, modifications, or clarifications to the codebook after the data collection process commenced. 2.6 Risk of Bias After training in the assessment criteria (led by SG) and DistillerSR software (led by SDT), two reviewers (a combination of SG and either ED or MSC) independently assessed the methodological quality of systematic reviews using AMSTAR-2 (Shea et al., 2017), risk of bias in systematic reviews using ROBIS (Whiting et al., 2016), and the risk of bias of primary studies using the RoB 2 for randomized trials (J. A. C. Sterne et al., 2019) and ROBINS-I for nonrandomized trials (J. A. Sterne et al., 2016). 2.7 Synthesis Methods We narratively summarized descriptive information and risk of bias assessments about eligible systematic reviews and primary studies. We quantified the overlap of primary studies across systematic reviews using Corrected Covered Area (CCA) calculations (Bougioukas et al., 2022) and visualized overlap using a citation matrix and CCA pairwise tables (Pieper et al., 2014). To estimate intervention effectiveness, we conducted random effects meta-analyses using a robust variance estimation (RVE) approach (Hedges et al., 2010) implemented via the general workflow for modelling dependent effect sizes in the R metafor package (Viechtbauer, 2024). This includes using the clubSandwich package v. 0.5.10 (Pustejovsky, 2023) to apply a small sample correction to obtain cluster robust tests and associated confidence intervals. For domains involving inadequate degrees of freedom for RVE, we specified random effects meta-analysis in metafor without RVE. We ensured that all analyzed effect sizes were statistically independent using the following decisions rules: (a) if a study had multiple timepoints, we selected the post-intervention timepoint or the follow-up timepoint that was closest to the completion of the intervention; (b) because statistical dependencies remained due to multi-arm trails, we followed guidance from Cochrane to combine treatment arms into a single intervention group effect estimate (Higgins et al., 2022). We report effect estimates as standardized mean differences for continuous data and risk ratios for dichotomous data. We assessed the extent of heterogeneity statistically using \\(I^2\\) and \\(\\tau^2\\). We conducted meta-regressions to investigate sources of statistical heterogeneity in effect estimates by race/ethnicity, grade/school level, school type, geographic region/country, level of prevention, cultural specificity of interventions, comparator type, study/publication year, and risk of bias. We also conducted equivalence testing using two one-sided test (TOST) procedures (Lakens, 2017) and the TOSTER v. 0.8.3 package for R (Lakens, 2024). Using TOST, we specified upper and lower bound limits for each effect size (SMD and risk ratios): i.e., is, a minimal effect size of interest to test whether effects obtained in this meta-analysis falling within this range are deemed not to be practically different (even in cases of statistically significant or non-significant differences between groups). We used SMDs of +/-0.10 as equivalence bounds for continuous outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes, we converted these SMDs to odds ratios using the logit method, and then converted these odds ratios to risk ratios using 11% as the non-exposed prevalence rate of a current anxiety disorder diagnosis (Ghandour et al., 2019), yielding risk ratios of 0.85 and 1.17 for the lower and upper bounds. In addition, we estimated the probability that the true effect of school-based anxiety prevention interventions will be null or higher in a new study using the cumulative distribution function for the t-distribution (IntHout et al., 2016). "],["results.html", "3 Results 3.1 Characteristics of Included Systematic Reviews 3.2 Characteristics of Eligible Primary Studies 3.3 Effects of School-Based Anxiety Prevention Interventions 3.4 Variation in Effects by Methodological, Demographic, and Intervention Characteristics", " 3 Results Our search yielded 5,989 citations (see Figure 1). We retained 565 citations (11%) for full-text eligibility assessment. Of the 565 full-texts assessed, we identified 16 eligible systematic reviews (3% of full-texts assessed for eligibility; &lt;1% of all citations identified in our search). These 16 systematic reviews included 326 primary studies, of which 35 (11%) met our eligibility criteria. In summary, we included 16 systematic reviews and 35 primary studies in this overview. 3.1 Characteristics of Included Systematic Reviews Overall, these 16 reviews were published between 2011 and 2023, with a median publication year of 2017 (see Table 1). Across all reviews, 23 bibliographic databases and search engines were used to identify eligible studies; review authors most commonly searched PsycInfo (16 reviews; 100%), Medline or PubMed (13 reviews; 81%), and ERIC (8 reviews; 50%) and Google Scholar (8 reviews; 50%). When reported, the year that each review last conducted their literature search ranged from 2010 to 2021, with a median of 2018. Regarding research transparency, 11 reviews (69%) included a flow diagram of information through the different phases of a systematic review (Page et al., 2021), 8 reviews (50%) reported a registration number for their review (Booth et al., 2012), and 5 reviews (31%) provided statements about the data and code underlying the review (Page et al., 2022). 3.1.1 Methodological Quality and Risk of Bias of Included Systematic Reviews AMSTAR-2 assessments (see Table 2) yielded methodological quality ratings of moderate for 2 reviews (13%), low for 6 reviews (38%), and critically low for 8 reviews (50%). Weaknesses of methodological quality in at least half of reviews included not reporting funding sources for included studies (16 reviews; 100%), justification for excluding individual studies (15 reviews; 94%), not using a comprehensive literature search strategy (12 reviews; 75%), not explaining the selection criteria used to identify included study designs (11 reviews; 69%), not using a satisfactory technique for assessing risk of bias in included studies (11 reviews; 69%), not having publicly available analysis intentions (8 reviews; 50%), and not assessing the impact of risk of bias in individual studies on evidence synthesis results (8 reviews; 50%). ROBIS assessments (see Table 3) yielded ratings of low risk of bias for 4 reviews (25%) and high risk of bias for 12 reviews (75%). Concerns about risk of bias were most commonly related to not assessing risk of bias formally using appropriate criteria (10 reviews; 63%) and not searching an appropriate range of sources for published and unpublished reports (8 reviews; 50%). 3.1.2 Overlap of Primary Studies Across Systematic Reviews The number of primary studies included in each review ranged from 11 to 136, with a median of 44. Of the 326 primary studies included across all reviews, 155 studies (47.5%) were included in more than one review (see Figure 2). Of the 35 primary studies meeting our eligibility criteria, 26 studies (74.3%) were included in more than one review (see Figure 3). The overall CCA percentage for all primary studies included across reviews (11.1%) was lower than the overall CCA percentage for primary studies meeting our eligibility criteria (24.6%). These numbers indicate high overlap across reviews in all primary studies, with very high overlap across reviews in primary studies eligible for our overview (i.e., school-based anxiety prevention delivered directly to students during school hours). Importantly, no single review identified all primary studies eligible for our overview—including reviews directly focused on school-based anxiety prevention (Caldwell et al., 2019; Feiss et al., 2019; Gallegos et al., 2012; Mychailyszyn, 2011; Werner-Seidler et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023) as opposed to reviews that had a more general remit (e.g., anxiety prevention across all ages and settings) or specific remit (only universal or targeted school-based anxiety prevention interventions). 3.2 Characteristics of Eligible Primary Studies The 35 primary studies on interventions delivered during school hours (see Table 4) were published between 1995 and 2021 (with a median of 2011). Most studies (n = 21; 60%) did not report start dates for participant recruitment; among the 14 studies (40%) that did, start dates for participant recruitment ranged from 2000 to 2016 (with a median of 2009). Most studies (n = 23; 66%) also did not report start dates for participant recruitment; among the 12 studies (34%) that did, end dates for completing data collection ranged from 2003 to 2017 (with a median of 2009). Unless otherwise indicated, the percentages below include all studies in the denominator (including those with missing data). 3.2.1 Study Design Regarding number of interventions and comparisons trialed per study, 27 studies (77%) had two groups, and 8 studies (23%) had three groups. In terms of study design, 3 studies (9%) randomized individual students to interventions, 28 studies (80%) randomized clusters of students to interventions, and 4 studies (11%) used non-random assignment. Of the 28 cluster-randomized trials, 20 studies (71%) randomized schools, 7 studies (25%) randomized classrooms, and 1 (4%) study randomized districts. Among the cluster-randomized trials reporting this information, the average cluster size ranged from 10 to 874 (with a median of 36). Regarding research transparency, 17 studies (49%) included a flow diagram of participants through the different phases of the study, 7 studies (20%) reported a registration number for their study, and 2 studies (6%) provided availability statements about the materials, data, and/or code underlying the results that they reported. 3.2.2 Participants The 35 included primary studies included 17,950 students (median: 303 students per study, range: 20 to 2,288) and at least 380 schools (median: 7 schools per study, range: 1 to 63, one study did not report number of schools). Only 13 studies (37%) reported the number of classrooms. Of the 27 studies (77%) reporting student age, the average age of students ranged from 8.8 to 16.3 (with a median of 10.3). Regarding school level, 25 studies (71%) included elementary schools, 18 studies (51%) included middle schools, and 6 studies (17%) included high schools. The most common grade levels were 4th grade (15 studies; 40%), 6th grade (12 studies; 34%), 5th grade (11 studies; 31%), 3rd grade (10 studies; 29%), and 7th grade (9 studies; 26%). The average percentage of students who were female ranged from 0% to 100% (with a median of 52%). 3.2.3 Settings The most common countries in which studies took place were Australia (15 studies; 43%), Canada (5 studies; 14%), United Kingdom (4 studies; 11%), and Ireland (2 studies; 6%); no included studies took place in the United States. Of the 25 studies (71%) reporting information on area type, 8 studies (32%) took place in rural areas, 4 studies (16%) took place in suburban areas, and 20 studies (80%) took place in suburban areas. Of the 21 studies (60%) reporting information on school type, 16 studies (76%) took place in public schools, 4 studies (19%) took place in private schools, and 5 studies (24%) took place in parochial schools. 3.2.4 Experimental Interventions Across all 35 primary studies, 43 experimental interventions were evaluated. Regarding format of the 43 experimental interventions, 6 (14%) were administered to individuals, 5 (12%) were administered to small groups, and 33 (77%) were administered to whole classes. The duration of interventions ranged from 1 to 20 weeks (with a median of 9), the number of sessions ranged from 2 to 20 (with a median of 9), and the length of each session ranged from 30 to 120 minutes (with a median of 55). Of the 42 interventions for which frequency of intervention delivery was reported, 3 interventions (7%) were delivered 2-4 times a week, 37 interventions (88%) were delivered once a week, and 2 interventions (5%) were delivered less than weekly. Of the 42 interventions for which provider information was reported, 13 interventions (41%) by behavioral health personnel, 11 interventions (26%) by researchers, 22 interventions (52%) were delivered by teachers, 7 (17%) were self-administered, 6 interventions (14%) by counselors, 1 intervention (2%) by other school personnel, and 2 interventions (5%) by other providers. All interventions (100%) were delivered directly to students, 14 interventions (33%) to family, and 1 (1%) each to teachers, staff, and the community. In addition to delivery during school hours, 11 interventions (26%) also involved a component that took place out-of-school time but on school groups (e.g., after school), 3 interventions (7%) involved a component that took place at home, and 1 intervention (2%) involved a component that took place in the community. For intervention mode, 40 interventions (93%) involved in-person delivery, and 7 interventions (16%) involved digital delivery. Across the 43 interventions, 33 (77%) reported monitoring intervention implementation to assess delivery as intended, and 11 (26%) reported that there was uncontrolled variation or degradation in intervention implementation. 3.2.5 Comparison Interventions Overall, the 35 primary studies had 35 comparison interventions. Of these 35 comparison interventions, 15 (43%) involved business-as-usual, 6 (17%) involved no intervention, 10 (29%) involved a wait-list control, 1 (3%) involved a different active intervention, and 3 (9%) involved an attention-control intervention. 3.2.6 Risks of Bias Of the 3 individually-randomized trials, we rated 2 studies (66%) as high risk of bias due to problems in the randomization process and missing outcome data. We rated the other 1 study (33%) as having only some concerns. Of the 28 cluster-randomized trials, we rated 18 studies (64%) as high risk of bias for at least one follow-up, and the other 10 studies (36%) as having only some concerns. Of the 4 non-randomized trials, we rated 3 studies (75%) as critical risk of bias due to confounding and missing outcome data. We rated the other 1 study (25%) as having serious risk of bias. 3.3 Effects of School-Based Anxiety Prevention Interventions We first summarize the most applicable finding from each eligible review. We then report results for meta-analyses (and narrative findings when meta-analyses were not possible) of primary studies meeting our eligibility criteria. 3.3.1 Findings from Eligible Systematic Reviews Meta-analyses from previous reviews have generally found that school-based anxiety prevention interventions may have modest positive impacts on anxiety. Several reviews found positive impacts of school-based anxiety prevention interventions for children and adolescents in general (Feiss et al., 2019; Werner-Seidler et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). In addition, Zhelinsky-Denyer (2015) found no difference between school-based and non-school-based anxiety prevention interventions for youth 14 years of age and younger. In terms of stages of prevention, several reviews (Gee et al., 2020; Hugh-Jones et al., 2021; Mychailyszyn, 2011) found that targeted school-based interventions had a significant effect on reducing anxiety symptoms, while Ahlen et al (2015) and Johnstone et al. (2018) had conflicting findings about the impact of universal programs on anxiety symptoms. In terms of types of intervention, reviews specifically found positive impacts on anxiety for the FRIENDS program (Maggin &amp; Johnson, 2014), cognitive-behavioral prevention interventions (Caldwell et al., 2019; Gallegos et al., 2012), and resilience-focused interventions (Dray et al., 2017). In terms of provider, Teubert and Pinquart (2011) did not detect a statistically significant effect for interventions delivered by teachers. 3.3.2 Anxiety Diagnosis Eight studies (23%) comprised of 5,286 students (29%) reported data on anxiety diagnosis that could be used in meta-analysis. These studies measured anxiety diagnosis through established thresholds for either Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SPAC; 5 studies; 63%) or the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), or Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C; 1 study each, 13% each). Length of follow-up for outcome measurement ranged from 0 to 35 weeks post-intervention (with a median of 0 weeks). Each study contributed 1 effect estimate to the meta-analysis. Students receiving anxiety prevention interventions had a 35% reduced risk of meeting criteria for an anxiety diagnosis relative to students in control groups (risk ratio = 0.65, 95% CI [0.42 to 1.01], 95% PI [0.34 to 1.26], \\(I^2\\) = 17%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.06). The TOST procedure indicated that the observed effect size (Risk Ratio\\(_{\\log}\\) = -0.426) was not significantly within the equivalent bounds of \\(RR_{\\log}\\) +/-0.69 (Z = 1.223 p = 0.889). Using 11% (110 per 1,000) for the assumed baseline risk of a current anxiety disorder diagnosis (Ghandour et al., 2019), this relative risk reduction translates into 39 fewer students meeting criteria for an anxiety diagnosis per every 1,000 who received a anxiety prevention intervention rather than a comparator, or a “number needed to treat” of 17. However, the prediction interval indicates that the possible underlying effect in a new study could range from a risk ratio of 0.27 to 1.66 (i.e., 73% reduced risk to 66% increased risk to meet criteria for an anxiety diagnosis). The estimated probability that the true effect of school-based anxiety prevention interventions on anxiety diagnosis will be null or better in a new study was 88%. 3.3.3 Subsyndromal Anxiety No studies provided outcome data on subsyndromal anxiety. 3.3.4 Anxiety Symptoms Twenty-eight studies (80%) comprised of 14,844 students (83%) reported data on anxiety symptoms that could be used in meta-analysis. These studies measured anxiety symptoms through the SCAS (18 studies, 64%), MASC (5 studies, 18%), Revised Childres Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS; 5 studies, 18%), GAD-7 (3 studies, 11%), Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS; 2 studies, 7%), Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A; 2 studies, 7%), SPAI-C (1 study, 4%), Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED; 1 study, 4%), and Anxiety Scale for Children (EAN; 1 study, 4%). The length of follow-up for outcome measurement ranged from 0 to 234 weeks post-intervention (with a median of 26 weeks). Each study provided 1 to 18 effect estimates for depression symptoms (median = 3, total = 118). We found that students receiving anxiety prevention interventions had lower anxiety symptoms relative to students in control groups (standardized mean difference = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.16, -0.01], 95% PI [-0.38, 0.21], \\(I^2\\) = 18%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.01). The TOST procedure indicated that the observed effect size (d = -0.09) was not significantly within the equivalent bounds of SMD +/-0.10 (Z = -0.27, p = 0.394). Using empirically-based benchmarks (Tanner-Smith et al., 2018), this effect size represents a small effect equal to the 25th percentile of the distribution of mean effects obtained for universal prevention programs focused on internalizing problems among school-aged youth. However, the prediction interval indicates that the possible underlying effect in a new study could range from a standardized mean difference of -0.38 to 0.21 (i.e., a medium beneficial effect to a small harmful effect). The estimated probability that the true effect of school-based anxiety prevention interventions on anxiety symptoms will be null or lower in a new study was 83%. 3.3.5 Depression Symptoms Seventeen studies (49%) comprised of 12,007 students (67%) reported data on depression symptoms that could be used in meta-analysis. These studies measured depression symptoms through the Childrens Depression Inventory (CDI; 10 studies, 59%), Centre for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D; 2 studies, 12%), Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ; 2 studies, 12%), Depression Questionnaire for Children (CDN; 1 study, 6%), Patient Health Questionnaire - short form (PHQ-5; 1 study, 6%), and Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS; 1 study, 6%). The length of follow-up for outcome measurement ranged from 0 to 234 weeks post-intervention (with a median of 26 weeks). Each study provided 1 to 12 effect estimates for anxiety symptoms (median = 2, total = 52). We found that students receiving anxiety prevention interventions had lower depression symptoms relative to students in control groups (standardized mean difference = -0.07, 95% CI [-0.13, -0.01], 95% PI [-0.27, 0.13], \\(I^2\\) = 0%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0). The TOST procedure indicated that the observed effect size (d = -0.07) was not significantly within the equivalent bounds of SMD +/- 0.10 (Z = 1.17, p = 0.122). Using empirically-based benchmarks (Tanner-Smith et al., 2018), this effect size is potentially trivial, as it is less than the 25th percentile of the distribution of mean effects obtained for universal prevention programs focused on internalizing problems among school-aged youth. In addition, the prediction interval indicates that the possible underlying effect in a new study could range from a standardized mean difference of -0.27 to 0.13 (i.e., a medium beneficial effect to a trivial negative effect). 3.3.6 Educational Achievement Three studies (9%) comprised of 2,402 students (13%) reported outcome data on educational achievement. Skryabina et al. (2016) found national standardized test scores in reading, writing, and math did not differ between groups at 52-week follow-up. Collins et al. (2014) found no significant differences in spelling between the psychologist-led anxiety prevention program and comparison group students, but they did find significant differences between the teacher-led anxiety prevention program and comparison group students. Ahlen et al., (2018) found no significant difference between groups on teacher-rated academic performance at post-intervention and 52-week follow-up. 3.3.7 Self-Harm No studies provided outcome data on self-harm. 3.3.8 Stress No studies provided outcome data on stress. 3.3.9 Substance Use No studies provided outcome data on substance use. 3.3.10 Suicidal Ideation One study (3%) comprised of 2,288 students (13%) reported outcome data on suicidal ideation. However, the degrees of freedom are below the threshold to use robust variance estimation (Tipton, 2015), so results are reported narratively. Roberts et al. (2018) found significantly lower incidence rates of suicidal ideation at post-intervention and 52-weeks follow-up among students receiving anxiety prevention programs compared to control group students. 3.3.11 Well-being Five studies (14%) comprised of 4,388 students (24%) reported meta-analyzable data on well-being. However, the degrees of freedom are below the threshold to use robust variance estimation (Tipton, 2015), so results are reported narratively. Two studies (40%) measured well-being using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), while one study each (20% each) used the Culture-free Self Esteem Questionnaire, Kessler psychological distress scale - short form (K6), and Total Life Satisfaction questionnaire. We did not detect statistically significant differences between groups on student well-being (SMD = -0.06, 95% CI [-0.18, 0.06], 95% PI [-0.18, 0.06], \\(I^2\\) = 0%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0). The TOST procedure indicated that the observed effect size (d = -0.06) was not significantly within the equivalent bounds of SMD +/- 0.10 (Z = -0.64, p = 0.261). 3.4 Variation in Effects by Methodological, Demographic, and Intervention Characteristics Tests for residual heterogeneity remained significant in all meta-regression models (i.e., in every model, the variability in the observed effect sizes not accounted for by the moderator included in the model is larger than would be expected based on sampling variability alone). For type of type of assignment to interventions (randomized or not), the moderator test was statistically significant (F[1,18.65] = 68.1, p &lt; 0.0001): trials using random assignment had significantly lower effect sizes (i.e., greater reductions in anxiety symptoms) compared to the one study using non-random assignment (non-random SMD = 0.22; random SMD = -0.31, 95% CI [-0.39 to -0.23]). The moderator test was also statistically significant for type of school (F[1, 16.3] = 7.9, p = 0.01): studies including public schools had significantly higher effect sizes (i.e., smaller reductions in anxiety symptoms) compared to studies not including public schools (no public schools SMD = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.36 to -0.06; public schools SMD = -0.002, 95% CI [-0.08 to 0.09]). Based on this meta-regression results, we conducted the TOST procedure on studies that included public schools, which indicated that the observed effect size was significantly within the equivalent bounds of SMD +/- 0.10 (Z = -2.674, p = 0.004)—suggesting a null effect on average in studies that included public schools. As “studies including public schools” involved studies with a mix of public and other school types, we ran an additional exploratory analysis with five moderator levels: studies with public schools only, private schools only, parochial schools only, mix of school types, and “cannot tell” type of school. The moderator test for this analysis was not statistically significant (F[5, 1.17] = 11.2, p = 0.185). We did not detect statistically significant associations between anxiety symptoms and school level (secondary or not), country (Australia or not), level of prevention (universal or targeted), type of comparator (business as usual or not), years since publication, percent female in the sample, and risk of bias (high or not). "],["conclusions.html", "4 Conclusions", " 4 Conclusions We identified 16 eligible systematic reviews that included 326 primary studies overall; of these, 35 primary studies evaluated 43 experimental interventions delivered directly to 17,950 students during normal school hours. Findings suggest that school-based anxiety prevention interventions may have a positive impact on anxiety among students. Our confidence in meta-analytic findings is reduced by the number of studies with plausible explanations other than differences in interventions received (i.e., risks of bias). For anxiety diagnoses, our confidence is also reduced by imprecision (i.e., a confidence interval that includes average effects of both reduced and increased risk of an anxiety diagnosis). Moreover, there is substantial unexplained heterogeneity in study effect estimates and wide prediction intervals, even in the meta-regression with significant moderator test for whether studies included public schools—and we did not detect a statistically significant moderation effect when examining the five discrete levels of school type. Consequently, while the evidence suggests schools implementing these interventions in contexts similar to those in the review are more likely than not to see improvements in anxiety diagnoses and symptoms, users of this evidence should be aware that current research evidence suggests both positive and negative effects are possible, and we do not have strong evidence to indicate what predicts positive versus negative effects. Strengths of this review include the use of explicit research questions and eligibility criteria, prospective registration of the review protocol, eligibility assessment and data collection in duplicate, use of established techniques to assess risk of bias, and use of meta-analytic techniques that include all (dependent) effect sizes reported in eligible primary studies (even when the exact form of the dependence is unknown). Potential ways to improve the strengths of this review are to supplement our literature search for systematic review (e.g., grey and non-English literature sources) and conduct our own supplemental search for primary studies.
